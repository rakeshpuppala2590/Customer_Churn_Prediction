## üöÄ Features

- **Churn Prediction Models**: The project utilizes several machine learning models for predicting customer churn:
  - `XGBoost`
  - `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`
  - `Random Forest`
  - `Voting Classifier (ensemble model)`

- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** allows you to:
  - Select customers from a dataset
  - Input or modify customer features (credit score, age, balance, etc.)
  - Generate predictions with the option to visualize model probabilities

- **Explainable AI**: Explanations of the prediction are generated using **OpenAI API**. These explanations are based on the customer's details and the most important features contributing to churn risk.

- **Customer Communication**: The system can generate a personalized email based on the churn prediction, offering incentives or retention strategies.
